For this task, we're going to return to the student marks database exercise, and jazz it up with some methods. The code will be spread over three classes, but some of the basics will be filled in so you don't have to worry too much about how to set up classes and objects. You just have to write methods to move the information around.

The program consists of three classes, Student, StudentDatabase and MarksReport. The program starts by reading in and setting up the data. Your task is to take this data and add methods and code to perform the following (in order):
-  Print out "There are n students." Where n is the number of students.
-  Print out "The average mark is x." Where x is the average mark with decimal places.
-  Print out "The best student is <name> with a mark of xx." Where <name> is the name of the student with the highest mark (the highest mark will be unique) and xx is the mark.
-  Print out "The worst student is <name> with a mark of xx." Where <name> is the name of the student with the lowest mark (the lowest mark will be unique) and xx is the mark.
